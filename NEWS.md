* GW-153: Presets can now be shared again.
* GW-268: Added a fix that gives preset layers a correct id which ensures they are loaded and updated correctly

* GW-287: The FE will now make a call to the BE every 15 seconds enquiring if you are still logged in. If not, the headerbar is automatically updated to show that you need to log in.

2020-01-09
* GW-279: During a previous change, a bug was introduced that made it impossible to set a point for AIRMET/SIGMET. This has been resolved and you are now able to draw a point on the map again.
* GW-280: After having drawn a box or polygon, if you press the respective draw button again (either box or polygon) so as to move the drawn figure around or change its shape, a red border was shown around the drawing tools and the TAC was validated incorrectly. This has now been fixed

2020-01-02
* GW-184: Added autofilling of the change and probability groups when entering certain characters. For examplem, when typing 'B' in the change field, it will automatically fill in 'BECMG' as that is the only valid option starting with B.

2019-11-11
* Merged master into style/ADAGUC/from_npm
* Hide map pin during sigmet drawing
* Replaced the static adaguc-webmapjs.js file with the new NPM package. This solves an issue for the DWD where they want to add local WMS from their own workstation to GeoWeb-FrontEnd.
* Updated version of adaguc-webmapjs from 3.0.4 to 3.2.25
* Refactored the panelReducer which interacts with adaguc-webmapjs. Replaced cloneDeep with immer's produce where possible
* The redux state was becoming too big by putting the complete WMJSLayer object on the redux state. To prevent this, there is now a cloneWMJSLayerProps method which clone the a WMJSLayer instance properties required for the redux state.
* Removed "Aviation Message Converter" version info

2019-11-07
* Improved the user experience in Sigmet read-mode: when the Sigmet is not publishable, the mistake is highlight in red color

2019-11-06
* (Fix) GW-172: It is not possible anymore to have lower level higher than upper level.
* (Fix) GW-170: Added extra decimal and better explanation in placeholder and tooltip of Lat and Lon for Vulcano
* (Fix) GW-212: Future time is not possible anymore with Observed Sigmet
* (Fix) GW-210: Increased the border thickness around the fields with mistakes in Sigmet Edit mode

2019-11-04
* Added product export viewer, go to /#/exportedproducts

2019-11-01
* Updated tafselector with dropdown and clearer descriptions of TAF statuses
* When baseTime is used in case of amendments, it it displayed in the tafselector
* Frontend crash when amend button clicked is now resolved
* Ability buttons are now always populated.
* When an amended TAF is published, it is not displayed anymore in the TODO list. This is done by using the baseTime instead of validityStart.
* For validityEnd 3124 is now accepted, and it will remain 3124.
* Added refresh taf list button with tooltip

2019-10-31
* (Fix) GW-158: Validity start is directly updated when amend is pressed. This idone by an extra roundtrip to the server.
* (Fix) GW-182: Validation on BECMG groups is now done after amendment
* Delete TAF now works

2019-10-28:

* (Fix) GW-151: A published Taf can be ammended before it is active (before it enters its validity_start). Validity_start will remain the same. Validity period is not changed by the frontend, backend handles value of validity_start
* (Check OK) GW-158: When an active TAF is ammended, validity_start is updated by the backend.
* (Check OK) When an active TAF is corrected, the validity_start remains unchanged
